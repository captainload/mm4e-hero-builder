AGILITY
SPECIALIZATIONS: Balancing, Contorting, Maneuvering, Standing, Tumbling
Use Acrobatics to flip, dive, roll, tumble, and perform other acrobatic maneuvers, as well as keep your balance under difficult circumstances.

BALANCING
You can make an Acrobatics check to keep your balance during hazardous movement. A degree of failure means you spend your Move action just maintaining your balance and do not actually move, while two or more degrees of failure means you lose your balance and fall.
You are both Hindered and Vulnerable while balancing. You can ignore either condition for a +5 increase to your Acrobatics DC, +10 for both. If you fail a resistance check while balancing, make an immediate Acrobatics check against the original DC to avoid falling.

CONTORTING
Make a DC 25 Acrobatics check as part of a Move action to fit through a tight space wide enough for your head but too narrow for the width of your shoulders, or to reach through an opening wide enough for your hand, but too narrow for your arm. Failure means you make no progress that turn and don't actually move, while two or more degrees of failure mean you can't try again without Extra Effort and might actually become stuck and Immobilized.

MANEUVERING
A DC 15 Acrobatics check may allow you to ignore the Hindered condition imposed by certain kinds of terrain, if you can flip, tumble, or otherwise acrobatically maneuver around or through it.

STANDING
A DC 20 Acrobatics check lets you take the Stand action, removing the Prone Condition, without becoming Hindered that round.

TUMBLING
You can make a DC 5 Acrobatics check to lessen damage from a fall, reducing the damage by 1 rank per degree of success. A fall reduced to rank 0 damage does no damage and you quickly roll to or land on your feet as a free action.`

STRENGTH
SPECIALIZATIONS: Climbing, Jumping, Running, Swimming
Use Athletics for physical feats like climbing, jumping, and swimming.

CLIMBING
With a successful Athletics check, you can climb along a slope, wall, or other steep incline. A failed Athletics check indicates you make no progress, and two or more degrees of failure means you fall from whatever height you attained. You are Vulnerable while climbing unless you accept a +5 increase in the DC.

JUMPING
You can jump distance rank 0 as a running long-jump, essentially moving Speed 1 and then jumping the distance as one Move action. You can jump distance rank -1 as a standing long-jump with no initial movement and make a vertical jump of distance rank -2. Every degree of success on a DC 15 Athletics skill check increases jumping distance ranks by 1, to a maximum of +3.

RUNNING
You can make a DC 15 Athletics check as part of your Move action to run faster: success increases your ground speed rank by +1 until the start of your next turn.

SWIMMING
You can make a DC 10 Athletics check to swim at speed rank 0 (higher DC for rough waters). Each degree of success after the first increases swim speed rank by +1 for one round, to a maximum of your ground speed rank (normally 2).`

Deception is the skill of getting others to believe what you want them to believe. It covers things like acting, bluffing, fast-talk, trickery, and subterfuge.

BLUFFING
Make a Deception check to tell a believable lie, opposed by the target's Deception or Insight check.

DISTRACTING
You can use Deception for an impress check to distract an opponent in combat. If your check succeeds, your target is Vulnerable to your attacks, Defenseless with two or more degrees of success.

INNUENDO
You can use Deception to send covert messages using word-play and double-meanings in conversation (DC 10 for basic message, DC 15 for complex, DC 20 for new/detailed).

TRICKING
You can use Deception in combat for a Trick maneuver to mislead an opponent into taking a potentially unwise action.`

    fullText: `ULTIMATE EFFORT\nFORTUNE, HEROIC, FOCUSED\nYou can always do your best at some particular task when it really matters. Pick a specific type of check: attack checks with a specific attack, resistance checks with one Defense, or skill checks with one non-combat Skill, approved by the GM. You can spend a Hero Point on your chosen check to skip rolling the die and just treat the result as a 20 plus your check modifier. This is not a natural 20, and so does not count as an added success. This advantage must be used before you choose to roll the die for a check.\n\nThe following are some example Ultimate Efforts. Your Game Master may approve others:\n\n• ULTIMATE AIM: When you take the Aim action with any attack, you can spend a Hero Point to apply a 20 result to the attack check. Since the Ultimate Aim bonus is not a natural 20, it does not qualify as a Critical Hit.\n• ULTIMATE ATTACK: When you make an attack check with a specific attack, you can spend a Hero Point to apply a 20 result to the attack check. Since the Ultimate Attack bonus is not a natural 20, it does not qualify as a Critical Hit.\n• ULTIMATE RESISTANCE: You can spend a Hero Point to apply a 20 result to a resistance check with one Defense, such as Ultimate Toughness or Ultimate Will.\n• ULTIMATE SKILL: You can spend a Hero Point to apply a 20 result to checks with one particular Skill, such as Ultimate Investigation or Ultimate Stealth.\n\nFOCUSED: You can take Ultimate Effort multiple times to apply its benefits to different specific checks, choosing a different check each time. Your maximum Ultimate Effort advantages are limited by your total ranks in heroic advantages.`
